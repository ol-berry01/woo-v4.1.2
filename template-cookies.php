				<h2 class="section-title">What are cookies?</h2>
				<p>Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. While you’re browsing golfcaruk.com &amp; parts.golfcaruk.com we use cookies to keep track of what you have in your basket, and to remember you when you return to our site.</p>
				
				<p>To order products on golfcaruk.com &amp; parts.golfcaruk.com, you need to have cookies enabled - see the section on Managing cookies. If you don't wish to enable cookies, you'll still be able to browse the site and use it for research purposes. Most web browsers have cookies enabled, but see Managing cookies for help to turn them on should you need to.</p>
				
				<p>Please note that cookies can't harm your computer. We don't store personally identifiable information such as credit card details in cookies we create, but we do use encrypted information gathered from them to help improve your experience of the site. For example, they help us to identify and resolve errors, or to determine relevant related products to show you when you're browsing.</p>
				
				<p>We do have relationships with carefully-selected and monitored suppliers who may also set cookies during your visit to be used for remarketing purposes - in other words to show you different products and services based on what you appear to be interested in. If you'd like to opt out, please go to the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" style="color:#333;transition:300ms;"><strong>Network Advertising Initiative website</strong></a> (opens in a new window - please note that we're not responsible for the content of external websites).<br>
				<strong>Do not track</strong> (DNT) is a feature offered by some browsers, with some newer browsers offering it as default. If you enable it, it sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing isn't tracked, for example by third party ad or social networks, or analytic companies. You can opt out of tracking and analytics on this website by changing your settings in the Managing Cookies section on this page.<br>
				At present no industry-wide uniform standard has been agreed and adopted to determine how DNT requests should be managed, so our website doesn’t currently respond to DNT requests. Until that standard is established, we'll continue to review DNT and other new technologies, but won't respond to DNT requests.</p>
				
				<p>We're giving you this information as part of our initiative to comply with recent legislation, and to make sure we're honest and clear about your privacy when using our website. We know you'd expect nothing less from us, and please be assured that we're working on a number of other privacy and cookie-related improvements to the website.</p>
